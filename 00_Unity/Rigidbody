In Unity, a Rigidbody component is used to simulate physics interactions such as gravity, forces, and collisions for GameObjects. When a GameObject has a Rigidbody attached, it becomes subject to the physics simulation in the game world.

Here are the basic steps to use Rigidbody in Unity:

1. Adding a Rigidbody Component: Select the GameObject you want to apply physics to and click on "Add Component" in the Inspector window. Then, search for "Rigidbody" and add it. Alternatively, you can use the "Add Component" button and choose "Physics" > "Rigidbody."

2. Adjust Rigidbody Properties: Once you've added a Rigidbody component, you can adjust its properties such as mass, drag, and constraints. These properties define how the GameObject interacts with the physics simulation.

3. Interacting with Colliders: To interact with other objects in the scene, you'll typically need colliders attached to both GameObjects. Colliders define the shape of the GameObject's collision boundary, while the Rigidbody component allows it to react to collisions and forces.

4. Applying Forces: You can apply forces to a GameObject with a Rigidbody using functions like AddForce, AddTorque, etc. These forces can be applied continuously, like gravity, or in response to specific events, like player input.

5. Handling Collisions: Unity provides collision detection through events and functions. You can use functions like OnCollisionEnter, OnCollisionExit, etc., to detect when collisions occur and perform actions accordingly.

Here's a simple example of how you might use Rigidbody in Unity to apply a force to a GameObject:

```C#
using UnityEngine;

public class RigidbodyExample : MonoBehavoir
{
    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        rb.AddForce( Vector3.forward * 10f, ForceMode.Impulse );
    }
}
```

In this example, a force is applied to the Rigidbody component of the GameObject in the forward direction using AddForce. The force is applied as an impulse, which means it's applied instantly rather than continuously over time.

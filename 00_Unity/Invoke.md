In Unity, Invoke is a method used to execute a specified function after a specified amount of time has passed. It's a way to delay the execution of a method or function call. The Invoke method can be called on any MonoBehaviour script, as it's part of the MonoBehaviour class.

Here's the basic syntax of the Invoke method:

```C#
void Invoke(string methodName, float time);
```

- methodName: The name of the method to be invoked after the specified time.
- time: The delay (in seconds) before invoking the method.
Alternatively, you can use the overload that accepts a method delegate:

```C#
void Invoke(System.Action method, float time);
```
- method: A delegate representing the method to be invoked after the specified time.
- time : 

```C#
using UnityEngine;

public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
        // Invoke the method named "MyMethod" after 2 seconds
        Invoke("MyMethod", 2f);

        // Alternatively, you can use a lambda expression with a delegate
        Invoke(() => Debug.Log("This is invoked after 3 seconds."), 3f);
    }

    private void MyMethod()
    {
        Debug.Log("MyMethod has been invoked!");
    }
}
```

In this example, the Start method invokes the MyMethod function after 2 seconds using the string-based method invocation and after 3 seconds using the delegate-based invocation with a lambda expression.

It's important to note that Invoke is useful for simple scenarios where you need to delay a method call by a fixed amount of time. If you need more control over the timing or need to repeat the invocation, you may want to consider using coroutines or other timing mechanisms offered by Unity.

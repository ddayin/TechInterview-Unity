In C#, an event is a mechanism that enables an object to notify other objects when a particular action or state change occurs. Events are commonly used in the implementation of the observer pattern, where an object (the subject or publisher) maintains a list of dependent objects (observers or subscribers) and notifies them of changes.

Here's a basic overview of how events work in C#:

Defining an Event:
To define an event in C#, you first declare a delegate type that represents the method signature of the event handlers. Then, you declare an event using that delegate type.

```C#
// Define a delegate type for the event handlers
public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);

// Declare an event of type EventHandler
public event EventHandler MyEvent;
```
Subscribing to an Event:
Objects interested in receiving notifications from an event can subscribe to it by attaching event handler methods to the event.

```C#
// Subscribe to the event by attaching an event handler method
obj.MyEvent += MyEventHandlerMethod;
```

Defining Event Handler Methods:
Event handler methods are methods that match the signature of the delegate type associated with the event. These methods are invoked when the event occurs.

```C#
// Event handler method
private void MyEventHandlerMethod(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Handle the event
}
```

Raising an Event:
The object raising the event invokes the event by calling it like a method. This notifies all subscribed event handler methods.

```C#
// Raise the event
MyEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
```

Here's a more complete example demonstrating the usage of events:

```C#
using System;

public class Publisher
{
    // Define a delegate type for the event handlers
    public delegate void EventHandler(object sender, EventArgs e);

    // Declare an event of type EventHandler
    public event EventHandler MyEvent;

    // Method to raise the event
    public void RaiseEvent()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event raised.");
        // Raise the event
        MyEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
}

public class Subscriber
{
    // Event handler method
    public void HandleEvent(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Event handled by Subscriber.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
        Subscriber subscriber = new Subscriber();

        // Subscribe to the event
        publisher.MyEvent += subscriber.HandleEvent;

        // Raise the event
        publisher.RaiseEvent();
    }
}
```

In this example, Publisher defines an event named MyEvent, and Subscriber attaches an event handler method HandleEvent to this event. When Publisher raises the event, the HandleEvent method of Subscriber is invoked, and it handles the event.
